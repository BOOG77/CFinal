You and your team are software developers hired by a business solutions company to create a Smart Business Management System for a client looking to automate their operations.

The client is a mid-sized retail store that struggles with:

    Inventory Management (Tracking stock, adding/removing items)
    Employee Payroll (Calculating salaries, handling overtime)
    Customer Transactions (Processing purchases and discounts)

Your team needs to develop a C-based software that automates these tasks efficiently while using the core concepts learned in this course.
